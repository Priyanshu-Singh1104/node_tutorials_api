Node is a Asynchronous Programing Language
Javascript is a Asynchronous Programing Language
PHP is a synchronous Programing Language

Node JS is A single Thread Language(only run single command execution).
Node JS is A not a Language.
Node JS is a Java Runtime Environment.
Node JS is A async Language.
sync means one by one execution ASC Order
Async means random execution (it is not waiting any script) it is a superfast

A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software that is made to execute other software. A JRE often contains three of the following elements: A Java Virtual Machine, a Java Classloader, and a Java Class Library.

The ClassLoader is used to load everything needed to execute a program. The Java Class Library contains a set (or library) of reusable code that can be used to make programs, and the Java Virtual Machine allows a computer to execute programs and applications written in Java.

Node JS contains all these elements thanks to Chrome’s V8, which was the engine used to build it. In short, Node Js is a Javascript Runtime Environment, and it’s used to execute JavaScript code outside of a browser.
